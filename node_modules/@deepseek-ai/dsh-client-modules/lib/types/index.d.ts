/**
 * Node half of the client module system (`dsh.client` dual-face package): scans
 * the host Loader's entries for packages declaring `dsh.client`, composes the
 * `window.__DSH_BOOT__` entry graph (wire single source: {@link WebBootEntry}
 * in `./client/manifest.ts`) in module-graph order, serves one-or-more-plugin
 * combo scripts plus their source maps,
 * contributes the registration facade, application preloads, bootstrap scripts,
 * and graph to the webserver's index injection table, and provides the
 * `clientModuleHost` service (the HMR node half's registration/notification
 * face).
 *
 * Scanning is incremental per package — there is no full-rescan code path.
 * Every cordis `internal/plugin` emission (fiber construction/disposal) marks
 * the fiber's entry name dirty; a microtask flush reconciles each dirty name
 * against the live loader entries. The activation pass seeds the same dirty
 * set with all current entries and flushes synchronously, so first scan and
 * steady state share one implementation. Package metadata (including the
 * negative "not a client package" verdict) is cached per Loader specifier and
 * owning-tree base URL until restart. The manifest package name identifies
 * the browser module; distinct active Loader sources for that package are a
 * composition error. Bundle content changes reach the graph only through
 * {@link ClientModuleRegistry.rebuilt}.
