/**
 * Persisted projection cache (`ctx.sessionProjectionCache`): durable
 * checkpoints of every projection unit's state, one record per session on
 * the `session_projcache` domain (`per-record` layout — the shipped json
 * backend stores one document per session under its root). Reads and writes
 * share ONE coherent state: the domain's in-memory tables serve every read
 * synchronously, and each write lands on the domain's write chain (durability
 * first, then memory), so a read can never observe a disk write the memory
 * has not applied, or a memory value the disk does not hold. The cache is a
 * fold shortcut, never an authority: a row
 * is possibly stale (its `seq` says how stale) but never wrong, so every
 * write path is fail-soft (a lost write costs a longer tail replay on the
 * next cold read) and a `ver` mismatch discards the row instead of migrating
 * it. Design authority: the session-projection RFC
 * (.agents/notes/proposed/architecture/2026-07-27-session-projection-and-command-log.md).
