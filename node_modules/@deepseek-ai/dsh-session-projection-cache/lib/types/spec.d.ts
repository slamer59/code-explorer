 * The session-projcache domain spec. The `per-record` layout scopes version
 * bumps per session: after a bump, a stale session document is discarded on
 * open (cache semantics — a stale or unreadable cache costs a longer tail
 * replay, never a wrong value) while the rest of the domain stays usable,
 * instead of rejecting the whole medium. The `compatibleVersions` entries
 * are declared because those records differ from the current version only
 * by the absent optional lineage fields, so upgraded homes keep serving
 * their cached listing projections instead of dropping every title until
 * each session is reopened; the per-record version map lives in the
 * read-compat Agent Note
 * (.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-02-projcache-cross-version-read-compat.md).
 * The per-row `ver` guard and the identity match still discard anything the
 * current fold semantics cannot vouch for.
 *
 * `invalidRecords: 'backup-and-skip'`: a stored record that fails the schema
 * anyway is disposable derived data, so it must never cost the boot — the
 * domain layer moves the document aside as `<key>.json.bak.<stamp>`, logs
 * the concrete validation failure, and serves the session as uncached (a
 * cold read rebuilds and rewrites it).
