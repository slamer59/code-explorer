/**
 * The measurement service's positional surface fold: the per-node priced
 * surface `measure()` serves and compaction plans against. The projection
 * units do NOT share this fold — their state must stay O(1) for the
 * persisted checkpoint, so they ride `surface-projection.ts`'s shadow-price
 * protocol; the two agree because both price through `estimate.ts` and every
 * logged shadow price derives from this fold's fixed-heuristic node prices.
 *
 * The fold is a plan/commit pair: {@link planSurfaceTokens} runs every
 * fallible step read-only and {@link commitSurfaceTokens} mutates in place,
 * so a throw leaves the caller's state untouched and the same malformed
 * event fails identically on every retry.
 * Nodes also carry their durable image occurrences and image-free heuristic
 * price, so `measure()` can reprice image content for the routed model.
 *
